                <h1>TLA+</h1>
                <blockquote>
                    <p> a high-level language for modeling programs and
                    systems—especially concurrent and distributed ones.</p>
                    <p>It's based on the idea that the best way to describe
                    things precisely is with simple mathematics.  TLA+ and its
                    tools are useful for eliminating fundamental design errors,
                    which are hard to find and expensive to correct in code.</p>

                <h2>What is it?</h2>
            </razzle-slide>
            <razzle-slide>
                <h2>Fundamental idea</h2>
                <p> We can model specify <i>behaviors</i> of
                systems, including computer processes, through descriptions of
                <i>actions</i> that update <i>states</i>.</p>
            </razzle-slide>
            <razzle-slide>
              Assume a fixed set of variables.
              <dl>
                <dt>States:</dt>
                <dd>Assignments of values to variables</dd>
                <dt>Behaviors:</dt>
                <dd>Infinite discrete sequences of states, with a starting
                  point, like: s₁, s₂, s₃, …
                </dd>
              </dl>
              Behaviors are naturally ordered by “tail of” relation, so 
              s₁, s₂, s₃, … is immediately followed by s₂, s₃, s₄ …
            </razzle-slide>
            <razzle-slide>
              <dl>
                <dt>Actions:</dt>
                <dd>Boolean valued expression, expressing relation between the
                  values of variables in two states, intuitively the current and next state.
              </dl>
            </razzle-slide>
            <razzle-slide>
              <h4>Examples of actions:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><code>x' = x + 1</code></li>
                <li><code>x = x' + 1</code></li>
                <li><code>x = y' ∧ y = x'</code></li>
              </ul>
              <p>NB: for some reason, “=” is a boolean operator and “≜” is
              definitional equality. Assignment would correspond to an action.
              </p>
            </razzle-slide>
            <razzle-slide>
              <h4> The Temporal Logic of Actions</h3>
              <p>TLA is a language that can be used to write statements that
                could be true or false within (at the starting point of)
                behaviors.
              </p>
            </razzle-slide>
            <razzle-slide>
                <p>Intuitively:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> “All (non-trivial) transitions conform to this action”: 
                    </li>
                    <li> “This action could occur”</li>
                    <li> “If this action eventually always could occur, it eventually does”</li>
                </ol>
            </razzle-slide>
            <razzle-slide>
              <p>One nuance. TLA is designed to ensure that behaviors always are
                allowed to “stutter”, i.e. fail to update anything. There seem to
                be at least two reasons for this.
              </p>
            </razzle-slide>
            <razzle-slide>
              <p> Stuttering is supposed to be more realistic.
              </p>
            </razzle-slide>
            <razzle-slide>
              <p> If behaviors can stutter, then “implementation is implication”
              </p>
              <p> For example, a spec for a clock with an hour hand and
                a minute hand will be implied by a spec for a clock with an
                hour, minute, and second hand, in the sense that every behavior
                satisfying the second spec satisfies the first.
              </p>
              <p> The idea is to ensure that you can leave out temporal detail
              in higher-level specifications, and then add it in without
              needing to backtrack.</p>

          | ENABLED Action

Form ≜ Predicate   | □[Action]ₜ | ¬Form 
     | Form ∧ Form | □Form
              </pre>
              <p>Where:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>□ means “always”, in every subsequent behavior</li>
              <li><code>[Φ]ₜ</code> abbreviates <code>Φ ∨ t'=t</code></li>
              </ul>

            <razzle-slide>
              <p>TLA+ extends the above (simple TLA) by adding general
                quantification, sets, and specific operators for use in
                actions.
              </p>

                <h2>How do you use it?</h2>
            </razzle-slide>
            <razzle-slide>
                <p>The main tool for using TLA+ is the <code>tlc</code> model checker.
                <p>Given a sufficiently descriptive statement in TLA+,
                <code>tlc</code> can attempt to generate a representation of
                all possible behaviors that conform to that statement.</p>
                <p> The representation (I think) is called a model</p>
            </razzle-slide>
            <razzle-slide>
                <p>“Sufficiently descriptive” means basically that the
                statement gives an initial assignment to each declared
                variable, and gives an update relation that pins down how state
                changes.
                </p>
            </razzle-slide>
            <razzle-slide>
                <h3>Example:</h3>
                <pre>
Init ≜ V = 0       // Nat
     ∧ pc = "Plus" // program counter

Plus ≜ pc = "Plus" ∧ pc' = "Minus" 
     ∧ V' = V + 1

Minus ≜ pc = "Minus" ∧ pc' = "Plus" 
      ∧ V' = V - 1

Next ≜ Plus ∨ Minus

Spec ≜ Init ∧ □[Next]ₜ
                </pre>

            </razzle-slide>
            <razzle-slide>
              <p>
                Models have a general graph structure; kind of like automata,
                with behaviors corresponding to automata runs.
              </p>
            </razzle-slide>
            <razzle-slide>
                <code>tlc</code> can also do some extra checks on the model:
                <ol>
                    <li> Invariants: make sure some predicate is true in every state</li>
                    <li> Liveness properties: statements that are true somewhere in any behavior.</li>
                    <li> More: e.g. “if φ is always true, then so is ψ.”</li>
                </ol>
                Basically check any TLA+ formula, abort if violation found.
            </razzle-slide>
            <razzle-slide>
                <p>The TLA+ language is pretty simple.</p>
                <p> But if you want to model algorithms, writing in pure TLA+
                still introduces a layer of indirection.</p>
            </razzle-slide>
            <razzle-slide>
                <p>One possible solution is to use a DSL for representing an
                algorithm, and then automatically translate to TLA+.</p>

                <h2>The Good:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Very expressive.</li>
                    <li>Learnable.</li>
                    <li>Some neat case studies of industrial applications: <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/industrial-use.html">https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/industrial-use.html</a>: Intel, Amazon, Microsoft, NASA, OpenComRTOS.</li>
                    <li>Use might be growing. In April 2023, AWS, Microsoft,
                        and Oracle became founding members of the TLA+
                        Foundation, launched by the Linux Foundation. The TLA+ Foundation
                        will “promote adoption, provide education and training
                        resources, fund research, develop tools, and build
                        a community of TLA+ practitioners.” Also functions as

                    <li>Only concrete models (symbolic model checker, apalache, seems immature). State explosion.</li>
                    <li><s>No spec ↔ implementation automation. A few academic
                      experiments (e.g. C2TLA+) translating PlusCal to and from
                      C.</s> Actually, there's PGo, which can translate PlusCal
                      to Go.
                    </li>
                    <li>No type system (by design), no pattern matching… Awkward recursion.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>TLA-toolbox (main TLA+ IDE) is not great.</li>
                    <li>Support for modern editors is limited. There's a VSCode
                        plugin, and syntax highlighting for other editors, but
                        that's about it.</li>
                    <li>TLAPs, proof system for TLA+, is not particularly well
                        documented (defunct "hyperbook", some video lectures).
                        I don't know if it's used.</li>

                    <li>Merge (by hand) the two resultant specifications, so
                        that the update relation updates state for both.</li>

              <ol>
                  <li>Add some checkpoints, where one algorithm will pause and wait for the other to catch up</li>
                  <li>Write invariants that say certain parts of the state are the same, when the algorithms are in sync.</li>
              </ol>
            </razzle-slide>
            <razzle-slide>
              <p>Basically works, probably wasn't a great idea.</p>
              <p>I think the main kind of algorithm comparison that TLA+ is
              intended for is <i>refinement</i>.
              </p>
            </razzle-slide>
            <razzle-slide>
              <blockquote>
                One develops a program through a series of refinements,
                starting from a high-level algorithm and eventually reaching
                a low-level program. Just as we went from Program 1 to the
                finier-grained Program 2… the entire process from specification
                to C code could in principle be carried out in TLA. “All” we
                would need is a precise semantics of C, which would allow the
                translation of any C program into a TLA formula.
              </blockquote>
            </razzle-slide>
            <razzle-slide>
              The ideal, I think, is refinement-driven-development, not
              verification of existing software.
